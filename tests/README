About the test suite 		-*- org -*-
====================

The test suite has two parts: the basic tests, which do not require
anything outside of this library, and networked tests, which require a
certain network setup if one wants to run them all.

The basic tests are run as part of `make check', while to run the
network tests, one must do a few other things, after which the
networked tests will be run aswell:

* Set up a mongodb server, and set up variables for the test suite

One must set the `TEST_PRIMARY' variable to the "IP:PORT" of the
mongodb server.

For example, assuming a bourne shell:

  $ TEST_PRIMARY="127.0.0.1:27017"; export TEST_PRIMARY

* To test replica sets, point the test suite to a secondary node

First of all, one will need to set up a Replica Set (see the mongodb
documentation for examples and a tutorial), and point the test suite
to a *secondary* node by setting the `TEST_SECONDARY' environment
variable:

  $ TEST_SECONDARY="127.0.0.1:27018"; export TEST_SECONDARY

Environment vairables relevant for SSL configuration (SSL tests):
 
 SSL_CERT_PATH, SSL_CA_PATH, SSL_KEY_PATH, SSL_KEY_PW, SSL_CRL_PATH

To set these variables automatically, do the following:
 1. Enter ssl/3party
 2. Run 'make' to generate certificates, keys, CRLs, etc.
 3. Run 'make revoke' to revoke server certificate in CRL

Then, you may go back to 'tests/' and run 'make check' to run all test cases.
Please note, that 'make check' must be run from 'tests/'.

Also, to make authentication succeed, you may create the test user like this:

db.addUser({"user":"test","pwd":"s3kr1+","roles":[{"role":"dbOwner", "db":"test"}]

For replica set tests, use the replSet parameter in your MongoDB configuration file.
